Matlab codes for experiments in Inhomogeneous Hypergraph Clustering with Applications
(NIPS2017).

The authors include three experiments, foodweb analysis, structural learning based on 
irish election data and motion segmentation based on Hopkins 155. You can run main.m in
each folder to see the test of the corresponding program for each experiment.

As Hopkins 155 is large, we only upload a part of the data. To have the full version, please check http://www.vision.jhu.edu/data/hopkins155/.
